Solar System Simulator

The Solar System Simulator program attempts to simulate the solar system as accurately as possible.

All the planets (and Pluto) are included.

// Input

Arrow keys can be used to change the focus of the screen.
Space bar can be used to pause/play the simulation.
Scroll wheel can be used to zoom in and out.

// Info

At starting positions, the planets are placed randomly in the space. They do not start at their current actual positions relative to each other.

The starting altitude (distance from the sun) is set as the orbit's apoapsis.
The starting velocity is set as the minimum velocity (as it would be at apoapsis).
This allows for an accurate depiction of the actual orbit (as the averages would give a perfect circular orbit).

The periapse's altitude is then calculated, so that an accurate orbital period can be calculated as well.
This is used to limit the trail effect's overlap.

The scale at which the planets are drawn is not related to their actual size.
Time is sped up by a factor of 1,000,000.

The code has a random solar system generator which can be set in code (still under construction).
The code also has a simulation of the earth, the moon and the sun. This can be set in code as well (still under construction).
The code is yet to be optimized.
